## Hello everyone ! Welcome to my Git Repositry !
I am Harinath Udatha .I am creating this file to let you Know about how I statred My Journey of 100daysRTLChallenge. 
      As an Undergraduate 3rd year student with huge interest in VLSI Industry , I started learning to dive into RTL coding 
      get more knowledge in my passion. I found some of my followees, connections and so of my seniors doing this challenge
      in Linkedin platform .So with a quite knowledge on Verilog because of my academics and started learning  Verilog from
      online platform like chipverify,javapoint etc. When I felt confident about my skill I announced #100daysRTLChallenge
      in my Linkedin profile . Here is how i am completing a day in Challenge

      #### -> Decide the design I need to Implement that
      #### -> Draw the logic diagram , Truth Table for that design
      #### -> Write Verilog code 
      #### -> generate Schematic and Simulation result
      #### -> create post for Linkedin

Here I am Using Vivado platform for my practice. I suggest to go from basic level design to advance design slowly, because it can helpful for you to so many new things in that journey.

##### I feel This may help you to start your RTl Journey too
                             ** Advance All the best for RTL Journey **
